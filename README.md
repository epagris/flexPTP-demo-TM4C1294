# EK-TM4C1294XL Connected LaunchPad flexPTP demo

![flexPTP CLI](TIVA.gif)

## What's this?

> **This is a [flexPTP](https://github.com/epagris/flexPTP) demo project showcasing the capabilities of the flexPTP [IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9120376) implementation for the [Texas Instruments EK-TM4C1294XL Connected LaunchPad](https://www.ti.com/tool/EK-TM4C1294XL) devboard.**

Still not clear what is it useful for? No worries, it's a behind-the-scenes support technology that use unaware every day if you have a smartphone or when you are connected to the internet. Modern telecommunication and measurement systems often rely on precise time synchronization down to the nanoseconds' scale. Methods got standardized by the IEEE and now it's known by the name of the Precision Time Protocol. This software project is an evaluation environment to showcase the capabilities of our IEEE 1588 PTP implementation named `flexPTP` on the Texas Instruments EK-TM4C1294XL Connected LaunchPad board.

### Get the sources

> [!NOTE]
> To acquire the full source tree after cloning the repo, please fetch the linked *submodules* as well:

```
git clone https://gitea.epagris.com/epagris/flexPTP-demo-TM4C1294.git
cd flexPTP-demo-TM4C1294
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## Building

### Prerequisites

The following two pieces of software are necessary for building:
- `arm-none-eabi-gcc` (v12+): the GCC ARM Cortex-M C cross-compiler
- `cmake` (v3.22+): KitWare's build management system

> [!NOTE]
> Both applications are available on common Linux systems through the official package repository. Although it's a Texas Instruments product, for building on Windows we recommend to install the STMicroelectronics [STM32CubeCLT](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeclt.html) bundle shipping the `arm-none-eabi-{gcc|gdb}`, `openocd`. The [CMake](https://cmake.org/) needs to be installed separately.

### Compiling

The project is fully CMake managed. Configure and invoke the cross-compiler using the commands below:

```
cmake . -B build
cmake --build build --target flexptp-tiva --
```
Once the building has concluded the output binaries would be deposited in the `build` directory: `flexptp-tiva.elf`, `flexptp-tiva.bin`, `flexptp-tiva.hex`

## Deploying

### Downloading the firmware

The compiled binaries can be downloaded onto the devboard through several tools:

### Using the `lm4flash` utility

This tool is part of the open source [lm4flash](https://github.com/utzig/lm4tools) bundle, that is also available through common Linux package managers.

To program the MCU use the following command: `lm4flash build/flexptp-tiva.bin`

### Using the `openocd` application

The [OpenOCD](https://openocd.org/) programming/debugging tool can also be used to upload the firmware using the following command:

`openocd -f "board/ti_ek-tm4c1294xl.cfg" -c init -c halt -c "program build/flexptp-tiva.elf" -c exit`

OpenOCD is also available through the common Linux package managers.

### Interacting with the firmware

The firmware prints its messages to and expect user input coming on the board controller's virtual serial port using the `115200-8-N-1` configuration. Use [Putty](https://www.putty.org/) or any equivalent (e.g. GtkTerm) serial port terminal to communicate with the firmware. On Linux, the device will show up as `/dev/ttyACMx`.

> [!NOTE]
> Read the firmware's bootup hints and messages carefully!

### PPS signal

The 1PPS signal is emitted on the `PG0` pin.

## Development

An all-around [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) project is packaged along the project to enable easy development, debugging and editing. To enable these powerful features, [CMakeTools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools), [Cortex-Debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marus25.cortex-debug), [Embedded Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-embedded-tools) extensions and the [OpenOCD](https://openocd.org/) software package. [clangd](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd) and clang-format are highly recommended.

Thas project has predefined *Launch* and *Attach* tasks.

### Software structure

The project is relying on the following large software building blocks:
- the [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/) embedded operating system,
- the [CMSIS RTOS V2](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_6/latest/RTOS2/index.html) module as a wrapper for FreeRTOS,
- the [TivaWare](https://github.com/antoinealb/Tivaware) peripheral library,
- the [Lightweight IP](https://github.com/lwip-tcpip/lwip) (lwip) Ethernet stack extended with PTP timestamp support,
- the [embfmt](https://gitea.epagris.com/epagris/embfmt) a printf()-like formatted printer implementation for embedded systems.

The project is organized the following way:

```
ROOT
  Drivers
    CMSIS: ARM CMSIS-related files (CMSIS RTOS V2 and device headers)
    tivaware: TI's peripheral library (submodule)
  Inc: headers for compile-time library configuration
  Middlewares: FreeRTOS CMake configuration
  Modules
    flexptp: our PTP implementation (submodule)
    lwip: the LwIP Ethernet stack (submodule)
    lwip_port: network interface and system specific implementations
    embfmt: a printf()-like formatted printer implementation for embedded systems (submodule)
  Src
    utils: TI-provided utilities
    task_eth.c: Ethernet stack management

    cli.c/h: CLI-interface implementation
    cmds.c: custom CLI commands
```
> [!NOTE]
> The flexPTP parameters are defined in the [flexptp_options.h](Inc/flexptp_options.h) header.

> [!NOTE]
> The low-level Ethernet network driver is located in the [tiva-tm4c129.c](Modules/lwip_port/tiva-tm4c129/netif/tiva-tm4c129.c) file.

### Printing and logging

In this project the memory-heavy `printf()` is replaced by the more embedded-optimized `MSG()` function backed by the `embfmt` library. Parameters and format specifiers are fully `printf()` compatible.

### CLI commands

The software offers you with the following multitude, most flexPTP-related of commands:
